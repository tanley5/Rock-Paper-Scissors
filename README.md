This is an exercise from The Odin Project.
The exercise requires that I create a console Rock, Paper, Scissors game
using JavaScript againts the computer.
The game will go for 5 times and it will show who the winner is.

The biggest challenge that I faced in this program is forgetting that the 
return keyword will end a function. Anythin after it will not be read. Thus
for the longest time I was not able to figure out that I needed to move the counters
above the return statement.

Overall, this was a great challenge, and I enjoyed it very much.
